# Which Search Engine?

**TL;DR** For OSINT / InfoSec dorking, use Google. 

**Google** is the king of search. They [dominate in market share](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share) - with massively more traffic, they understand & are constantly optimizing for what users search in ways other engines simply cannot. Google is especially good at complex advanced search and at long tail queries.

The downside to Google (and Bing) is with privacy - tracking can't be avoided. Enter **DuckDuckGo**. 

**Microsoft Bing** is the world's second largest search engine - but it's miles behind Google. To gain traffic & data, [Microsoft Rewards](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards) is currently paying consumers to use Edge and Bing. 

All major search engines handle common queries equally well - things like weather, dictionary, movie times, addresses. And Bing does an arguably better job than Google at displaying video & image results. 

While not the best for OSINT, Bing is included here because it has market share & supports advanced operators, and because Microsoft does invest in improving results.
